# extraction

## installers

### MSI
- 7z extract MSI file
- 7z extract the `_ABCD` hash file which is a windows cab file
- the files that result - are they the install? or just helper executables?

### exe
- extract zipped installer contents with `binwalk -Z -P -e`
- 7z can extract some exe installer formats
  - this will work well with some package formats, and with others maybe just produce metadata files?

# github

## no tags / versions
if something does not have tags/versions, useful info can still be obtained by doing a blame on the changelog.txt to get the commits
